<div class="declaration">
<code class="language-swift">func unsafeDowncast&lt;T&gt;(x: AnyObject) -> T</code>
<div class="comment">
    <p>Returns: <code>x as T</code></p>

<p>Requires: <code>x is T</code>.  In particular, in -O builds, no test is
performed to ensure that <code>x</code> actually has dynamic type <code>T</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Danger:</strong> trades safety for performance.  Use <code>unsafeDowncast</code>
only when <code>x as T</code> has proven to be a performance problem and you
are confident that, always, <code>x is T</code>.  It is better than an
<code>unsafeBitCast</code> because it&#39;s more restrictive, and because
checking is still performed in debug builds.</p>
